      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>
      	Docker is an open-source technology which makes containers easier to use. Because virtual machines (VM) hypervisors emulate virtual hardware, they are "fat in terms of system requirements", while containers use shared operating systems allowing them to use system resources much more efficiently. Subsequently, more and more developers are moving applications from virtual machines to container systems, where they can run up to six times the number of server application instances. Docker allows developers to easily pack, ship and run applications using portable containers that can run on virtually any system.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>
      	Nginx is a web server developed by Igor Sysoev to solve the C10K problem, a term that refers to latency problems faced by web servers when experiencing a large number (over 10K) of concurrent connections. Sysoev succeeded in creating a web server that "consistently beats Apache and other web servers in benchmarks measuring web performance".  Because of its success at handling a high number of connections, Nginx is also used as a reverse proxy and load balancer, as it has the capacity to handle incoming traffic and distribute to slower, upstream servers.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>
      	A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.  Virtual machines are usually referred to as a "guest" that is created within a "host" computer environment.  VMs are implemented via specialized software emulation or hardware virtualization, or a combination of both.  VMs might be used to perform tasks which usually are  not performed in the host environment, or for testing applications in different environments from the host system.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>
      	DigitalOcean provides cloud computing services for small businesses and developers to deploy and scale their applications. Virtual computers, or "droplets", at DigitalOcean use solid state storage, with the cheapest costing less than a penny an hour. That competitive pricing has allowed DigitalOcean to match and surpass Amazon's growth in "web facing computers" in recent years<sup>4</sup>, and it prides itself on its high performance machines.  All disk drives are SSD with network speeds of 1Gbps and droplet startup times under 1 minute (which compares favorably to the large cloud providers' startup times of up to 3 minutes), with independent performance tests demonstrating far better results than Amazon's<sup>5</sup>. Last year DigitalOcean launched its Kubernetes-based container service.<sup>6</sup>
